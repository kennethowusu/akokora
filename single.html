       <p>
         Earlier this year, my arms completely gave out as I was getting ready.
       </p>

       <p>
         I couldn’t even get dressed by myself. I was exhausted, and it
          wasn’t even nine in the morning. I suffer from post-polio syndrome,
          and I’m never sure when some new pain is a daily setback or the new
           normal.
          I didn’t want to go on like this. What was this day going to hold?
       </p>

       <p>
         I cried out to the Lord, telling him that all of this felt
         colossally unfair. I ended by declaring, “I can’t live like
         this for the rest of my life. I just can’t do it!” I felt frustrated
          and angry and overwhelmed all at the same time. I realize that may
          sound deeply unspiritual, but that’s how I felt. I couldn’t imagine
          living the rest of my life with those physical struggles.
       </p>

       <h2>In the Quiet</h2>
       <p>
         After my lament, I was quiet. I had said all I wanted to say. And then I waited.
          I’m not sure if I was expecting a
         response from God, but I knew I needed to be still and listen.
       </p>

       <p>
         “I’m not asking you to live like this for the rest of your life.
          I’m just asking you to live like this today.” Tweet Share on Facebook
        In the silence, the following words came to my mind: “I’m not asking you
         to live like this for the rest of your life. I’m just asking you to live like this today.”
        It felt like God was speaking to me.
       </p>

       <blockquote cite="http://">
         “I’m not asking you to live like this for the rest of your life.
         I’m just asking you to live like this today.”
       </blockquote>
       <p>
         Immediately, an unmistakable sense of peace settled over me.
          My situation was unchanged, but I felt strangely different. Today was a
          finite period that I could focus on. Today seemed doable. Today was much
           less frightening than “the rest of my life.”
          Coping with anything today seemed possible. Possible, that is, with God.
       </p>

         God was speaking to me.

        today seemed possible. Possible, that is, with God.

          After that flood of relief had washed over me, I thought of those words again:
          “I’m not asking you to live like this for the rest of your life. I’m just asking you to live like this today.”
          Could they have been the words of God to me? Were they consistent with God’s character? What does Scripture say about the words that came to me?
       </p>
       <h2>
         Daily Bread
       </h2>
       <p>
         I remembered that Jesus taught us to pray, “Give us this day our daily bread” (Matthew 6:11).
          God will meet our needs today. His grace is available for today. We are not to
          be anxious about the future, or even tomorrow,
          for every day has its own trouble <a href="#">(Matthew 6:34)</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
         draw near to me <a href="#">(James 4:8)</a>.

          And as I went through my day, I needed to rejoice in what God was doing, to pray without ceasing, to give thanks even in difficult circumstances, knowing all of this was God’s will for me (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18).

          Breath by Breath
          Rejoicing in trials is not easy for me. I have to deliberately focus on what
          God is doing in the midst of them. I must remind myself that although my trials
          seem heavy and endless, they are light and momentary in relation to eternity.
           And they are preparing for me a weight of glory that is beyond all comparison
            (2 Corinthians 4:17).
          </p>

          <p>
          When my struggles feel relentless, they force me to trust God day by day,
           moment by moment, breath by breath. Pain, whether physical or emotional or
           spiritual, has a way of capturing my attention. I can either focus that
           attention on myself and sink into despair, or I can direct my thoughts to
           Jesus and ask him for grace.
           </p>
         <p>
           <ul>
             <li>That moment-by-moment dialogue with God changes me.</li>
             <li>And his glory in ways that I would never have seen otherwise (2 Corinthians 3:18).</li>
             <li>Suffering has a unique way of putting me in God’s presence, beholding his glory, because I am constantly crying out to him.</li>
           </ul>
